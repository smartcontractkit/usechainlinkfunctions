# Fetch Discord Upvote Data

This function retrieves the number of upvotes a Discord member has received in the past 24 hours using the Discord API.

```js
const getDiscordUpvotes = async (memberId, apiKey, guildId, channelId, timeRangeMs) => {
  const endpoint = 'https://discord.com/api/v9'
  const timeRangeSec = Math.round(timeRangeMs / 1000)
  const time24HoursAgo = Math.round((Date.now() - timeRangeMs) / 1000)
  const headers = {
    'Authorization': `Bot ${apiKey}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
  const config = {
    method: 'GET',
    headers: headers,
    url: `${endpoint}/guilds/${guildId}/audit-logs?limit=100&user_id=${memberId}&before=${time24HoursAgo}&action_type=MESSAGE_DELETE`
  }
  const response = await Functions.makeHttpRequest(config)
  if (response.error) {
    throw new Error(response.response.data.message)
  }
  const auditLogs = response.data.audit_log_entries
  let upvotes = 0
  for (let i = 0; i < auditLogs.length; i++) {
    const log = auditLogs[i]
    if (log.action_type === 72 && log.target_id === channelId && log.created_at >= time24HoursAgo - timeRangeSec) {
      upvotes++
    }
  }
  return Functions.encodeUint256(upvotes)
}
