This is the repository for [usechainlinkfunctions.com](https://usechainlinkfunctions.com). Built as a quick weekend hack, the idea was to help showcase the awesome ideas built by the Chainlink developer community with Chainlink Functions.

Want to submit your example code? YES...Open up a PR to get your idea included. 

This project is built on Vercel using NextJS.
To run locally, `npm i`, then ``npm run dev`, then open [localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000).


## Format for new code example posts
1. Look at the examples for the correct format. Each post is a separate markdown file in the [_posts directory](https://github.com/bryanjowers/usechainlinkfunctions/tree/main/_posts)
2. Add your example. You only need to commit 1 new file.
3. Test it :) 
4. Open a PR
